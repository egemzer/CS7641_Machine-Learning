### Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

### Code Location
https://github.com/egemzer/CS7641_Machine_Learning/tree/master/TODO

### Overview

This project was completed by @egemzer (gth659q) for master's degree course in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech. 

TODO more info about the project.

### Datasets
Dataset 1: **Contraceptives Dataset** - in repo and available at https://www.openml.org/d/23
    
Dataset 2: **Arrhythmia** - in repo and available at https://www.openml.org/d/5

### Libraries
python 3.7.x, sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, timeit, datetime, copy, imblearn, warnings, 

TODO double check.

### How to Run the Code
To test this code on a local machine, you'll want to download the dataset and put it in the same directory as the code.

Run the program using the command 'python3 uldp.py'

### Plots
Each Python file outputs plots (as pop-ups), including:
- TODO

### Fair warning on reuse
Some of the dataset cleanup is fairly manual (as it always is), so using this repo for other datasets will require modification to the first ~125 lines which are mostly normalizing, cleaning, and otherwise preprocessing the two datasets to be classified.
